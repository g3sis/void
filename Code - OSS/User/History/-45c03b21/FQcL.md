# Sumary
This paper wants to give an overview about methods to achieve certainty about the distance between partners during their communication. A custom communication model is introduced, replacing the traditional characters Alice and Bob with Pete and Vera. This change reflects the roles of the parties involved, where one is consistently attempting to confirm their location, and the other is tasked with validating this information. The attacker is still called Eve. The first method written about is distance bounding. It is used to counter a few different attacks, two of which are relay attacks also known as mafia fraud and terrorist fraud. Distance bounding operates via a challenge-response protocol in which V issues a challenge to P, who must respond within a certain timeframe. Subsequently, two physical-level attacks on distance bounding are described. Other methods, including analog distance bounding, noise creation and whispering, authenticated GPS, noise measurement, environmental conditions, and fingerprinting, are also evaluated.

# Plus
- Custom model for communication   
- the different sections are arranged in a way that they build on each other 

# Minus
- not quite clear yet how the attacks on distance bounding work
 

# Comments
- maybe put different attacks into a single subsection instead of spreading them over multiple
