# Sumary
This paper wants to give an overview about methods to achieve certainty about the distance between partners during their communication. A custom communication model is introduced, replacing the traditional characters Alice and Bob with Pete and Vera. This change reflects the roles of the parties involved, where one is consistently attempting to confirm their location, and the other is tasked with validating this information. The attacker is still called Eve. The first method written about is distance bounding. It is used to counter a few different attacks, two of which are relay attacks also known as mafia fraud and terrorist fraud. Distance bounding itself works through a challenge response protocoll where V sends a challenge to P, who has to answer in specific amount of time. Two attacks on the physical level on distance bounding are evaluated afterwards. With analog distance bounding, make noise and whisper, authrnticated gps, measuring noise, ambient conditions and fingerprinting other aproaches will be evaluated. 

# Plus
- Custom model for communication   
- the different sections are arranged in a way that they build on each other 

# Minus
- not quite clear yet how the attacks on distance bounding work
 

# Comments
- maybe put different attacks into a single subsection instead of spreading them over multiple
