The paper discusses four different uses of homomorphic time lock puzzles. It initiates with an explanation of the time lock puzzle (TLP) variant proposed by Rivest-Shamir and Wagner, which describes a mechanism to encrypt a message M for a distinct amount of time T. This variant is mainly used for blockchain based mechanics and characterized by a generation function for a puzzle and one for solving it. The creation of these puzzles should take less time than solving them, and the puzzles should be robust against attacks using parallel algorithms. The encryption is based on sequential squaring, which ensures the robustness against parallel algorithms. To encrypt a message M, one  selects a pair of prime numbers and calculates the number of squarings possible in one second S, which is then multiplied by the time T for which the message should be encrypted. The message is encrypted with a key K, which is obfuscated by adding a random number squared ST times modulo the product of the two chosen prime numbers. For decrypting the message, a more efficient method is used to compute this offset. To make this approach more scalable in larger groups, Homomorphic Time Lock Puzzles were created. This approach calculates a singular function for many TLPS which yields a result for all of them instead of brute forcing every single one. Three types of HTLPS are introduced. Linearly HTLPS, Multiplicatively HTLPS and Fully HTLPS. The first application discussed are verifiable timed signatures. In this scenario, the recipient receives a signature along with a set of TLPs. They are instructed to compute a random number of these puzzles to verify each message’s signature before calculating the entire set. The use of LHTLPs would enhance the security of this process. Another application is E-Voting and Sealed Bid Auctions. First involves a voting process where each voter’s choices are embedded into puzzles, which are then combined into a vector. During the counting phase, these vectors are added up into a single vector, decrypted, and evaluated. While this method may not be practical for sealed bid auctions, it could theoretically be utilized using FHTLPs. The third application is multi party coin flipping, where several parties aim to find a common random bit amongst themselves. The use of HTLPs eliminates the dependency on the number of puzzles being solved for the number of participating parties. The fourth application discussed is multi party contract signing. In this scenario, multiple parties aim to sign a contract simultaneously. This is achieved through multiple rounds of signing a message, encrypting it in a TLP, and broadcasting it to the other parties, which then calculate the message and continue the cycle until one doesn't send anymore. An improved method employs MHTLPs to minimize the computations performed before broadcasting a newly signed message. The document follows up with an evaluation of HTLPs and TLPs, primarily by comparing them across different the approaches and demonstrating how HTLPs offer improvements over TLPs. It ends with a brief explaination where HTLPs are being used.    
  
# Plus
  + accurate description of related work in the beginning really helps to understand the concept
  + depiction in an algorithmic manor helps to grasp the different concepts 
  + described applications depict accurately how different versions of HTLPs could be used 
  
# Minus
  - The time aspect of tlps should be described further for easier understanding

# Comments
  - The correctness 'section' for TLPs 'confused' me a bit because it's only one bullet point which could maybe be formated into a sentence
